# AboutMe
Biography


Hello, my name is Brittney Watson. I am currently persuing my Master's Degree in Cyber Security. I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Management Information Systems, from the University of Tampa. In the near future, I plan to return after completing some final courses, gain some experience, get some certificatins and then start my own business. I find graphic designing very interesting, as I have my own graphic design business. The reason I chose this field was because  despite doing well in most of my course, I prefer to deal with computers rather than people.
